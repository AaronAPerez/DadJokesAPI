Comments:  I enjoy your program.  I like how you made the theme feel and look like dad jokes are real with Ned Flanders tweeting.  This was a great idea!  I think your date grab is good for showing the current date for when the tweet was posted.  Your html is easy to read and works well.  I'm glad I was able to see your code and I think ill see what I can do to improved my code to mirror the quality of this project.
